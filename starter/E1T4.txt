Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
1. Application server can be placed inside the private subnet so it's not accessible from the internet. 
The security groups should be more restrictive and only allow access from port 5000 and block all other ports

# Poor practice 2
2. Use server side encryption on the s3 bucket
